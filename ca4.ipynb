        "*   The data in Table 1 gives you the **series impedance** (`z = R + jX`) and the **total shunt susceptance** (`B`) for each line. The total shunt admittance is `y_sh = jB`. Remember that the shunt admittance is split in half at each end of the line in the π-model.\n",
        "*   **Step 1:** For each line, calculate its series admittance `y_series = 1 / z_series`.\n",
        "*   **Step 2:** Initialize a 5x5 matrix of complex zeros for your Ybus.\n",
        "*   **Step 3:** Populate the **off-diagonal** elements using the rule `Y_ij = -y_series_ij`.\n",
        "*   **Step 4:** Populate the **diagonal** elements using the rule `Y_ii = Σ y_series_ik + Σ y_shunt_i`. The total shunt admittance at a bus is the sum of the `B/2` contributions from every line connected to it."
